Fleet Commerce is a fast and fluid ecommerce API.

The API's database is established through Sequelize, allowing query data to be easily parsed. The database is set up with sample products, categories, and tags, which would all be found on a large ecommerce site.


## üèóÔ∏è Installation

To install, first clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:jacob-medina/fleet-commerce.git

Then, in the root directory of the project, install dependencies:

    npm install


## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

**This application requires a `.env` in the root directory** to use certain environment variables. You can create it with your specifications by running:

    npm run env

If you do not have a database created and in use, you can do so by running:

    npm run buildDB
